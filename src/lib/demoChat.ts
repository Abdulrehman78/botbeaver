If asked something unrelated, answer briefly then steer back to how BotBeaver can help.
Never invent private customer data. Do not claim you already booked a meeting — invite them to schedule.`;

Tell me whether you care more about phone, website chat, or CRM sync and I'll go deeper — or book a live demo and we'll map it to your stack.`;
